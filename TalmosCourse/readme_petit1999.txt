DESCRIPTION: Vostok Ice Core Data for 420,000 Years

Files content: "GT4" ice core chronology (gas and ice chronology), 
Deuterium and reconstructed temperature, Dust content, Sodium concentrations, 
CO2, CH4, atmospheric oxygen composition.

Vostok time scales : file "GT4nat.txt"
Column 1: depth (m)
Column 2: Age of the ice (GT4 chronology)
Column 3: Gas Age as deduced from the Barnola et al. (1991) model.


Deuterium - data : file « deutnat.txt » 
Column 1 -Depth (m)
Column 2 -Ice Age (GT4) 
Column 3 –Deuterium content in ‰ SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean Sea Water). 
Deuterium measurements have been performed on three adjacent cores 3G, 4G and 5G 
(see Figure 1 of Jouzel et al., 1996).  It combines results successively published 
in Jouzel et al. (1987, 1993 and 1996). 

Column  4 -Temperature difference wrt the mean recent time value 
(i.e. corresponding departure from –438  ‰ mean deuterium value)
Deuterium data is from core 3G between 138 and 2083 meters below surface (mbs) 
(with one long missing section between 312 and 320 mbs), from core 4G between 8 and 
138 mbs and between 1920 and 2546 mbs and from core 5G between 2504 and 2757 mbs. 
Ash layers help to make link between cores. No correction was applied for 3G and 4G 
core taken as reference depth. For 5G samples, a value of 3.41 m have been added 
to the depth measured in the field  below depth of 2500 m.
Deuterium values (column 3) have been measured on ice samples of length comprised 
between 0.5 and 2 m (down to 2080 m) then every 1 m. Data was re-interpolated on 1m 
intervals afterwards. The ice recovery is 85% or higher. Measurement accuracy is 
of ± 0.5‰ SMOW  (1 s). From the surface down to 7 m a constant value 
(derived from surface and pits samples) of -438.0 ‰ is reported. 
The temperature change indicated in column 4 (temperature above the inversion). 
This temperature is calculated using a deuterium/temperature gradient of 9‰/°C 
after accounting for the isotopic change of sea-water. No correction for the 
influence of the geographical position of the ice was applied.  


Dust content: file "dustnat.txt"
Column 1 -Ice Age (GT4) 
Column 2 – dust concentration in ppm 
The dust concentration was calculated from the total volume concentration 
(from Coulter counter measurements), and assuming a dust density of 2.500 Kg. m-3. 
Data from  Petit et al (1990), Jouzel et al. (1993) down to 2545 m depth 
have been included. 


Sodium content  file "nanat.txt"
Column 1: Ice age (GT4 chronology)
Column 2: Sodium concentration (ppb)
Data from Legrand et al.(1988) ,down to 2080 m have been included.


CH4 data: file"ch4nat.txt"
Column 1: Gas Age as deduced from the Barnola et al. (1991) model 
Column  2: CH4 concentration (ppbv). See note below


CO2 data: file"co2nat.txt"
Column 1: Gas Age as deduced from the Barnola et al. (1991) model 
Column  2: CO2 concentration (ppmv). 
CO2 and CH4 measurements have been performed using the methods and analytical 
procedures previously described (Barnola et al., 1987, Chappellaz et al, 1990). 
However, the CO2 measuring system has been slightly modified in order to increase 
the sensitivity of the CO2 detection. The thermal conductivity chromatographic 
detector has been replaced by a flame ionisation detector which measures CO2 
after its transformation into CH4. The overall accuracy for CH4 and CO2 measurements 
are ± 20 ppbv and 2-3 ppmv respectively. No gravitational correction has been applied.


Atmospheric Oxygen : file "o18nat.txt"
Column 1: 	 Gas Age as deduced from the Barnola et al. (1991) model 
Column2: d18Oatm   ‰
d18Oatm data published in Sowers et al.(1993) and Jouzel et al.(1993) have been included.
