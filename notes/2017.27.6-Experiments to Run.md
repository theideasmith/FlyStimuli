This is going to be a growing list of experiments to run. Each will have its own folder located in the top directory  `experiments/`. 

1. How do flies evaluate preference when there is one stimulus presented to each eye?

2. Do flies perform predictions of where the female ought to be over some timescale or do they instantaneously revert to the maximal intensity level default?

3. How do the psychophysics of modulation relate to the expected physical results and **what is the optimal intensity level in Drosophila?**

4. Do they care about changes or will constant distances matter?

5. *Parallax has no effect:* will they modify their behavior if the dimensions of parallax are removed from the data?

6. **Replicating Mitchell et. al. 2004)** 

   To do this, we could potentially do a similar kind of experiment. Then we'd use song amplitude as a proxy for determining female preference. 

   **amplitude as a proxy**

7. **When the rectangle rotates?** I dont think this was tried before.

8. **Do cued objects dominate during rivalry?**

9. **Is there anything intelligent in the noise*&?

Essentially, there are two classes of experiments:

1. Vertical. These are simple and just involve grid searches through parameter space. They are for optimizing particular metrics or dimensions
2. Horizontal. These are different discrete  the simple questions that can be answered by moving through the space of possible trajectories
