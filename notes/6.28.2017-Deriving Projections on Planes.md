## Deriving Projections on Planes

This is simple projective geometry stuff, your standard computer graphics problem. As I've never actually worked with computer graphics I need to derive these things myself. 

The problem is to determine the proper dimensions of a virtual fly projected onto the video-screen. 

The origin is defined as the real position of the male fly, $\mathbf{P}_\text{M} = \mathbf{0}$, with the male fly facing in the direction $\hat{\mathbf{j}}$. The video monitor is represented as a plane with normal $\hat{\mathbf{j}}$ and a point $\mathbf{V} = \left[ 0, D, 0 \right]$, where $D$ measures the distance between the male fly and the video monitor. The video monitor is then a plane defined by the equation $(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{V})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{j}} = 0$

Suppose the female fly is located at an azimuthal position $\phi$ relative to $\mathbf{\hat{j}}$ at a distance $R$ from the male fly. In cartesian coordinates, this becomes $\mathbf{P_F}= \left[ R\sin\phi, R\cos\phi, 0\right]$ 

If a light beam comes from the centroid of the female fly, we would like to know where this beam hits the plane. 

Take the normalized line starting from the male and going to the female. 
$$
\mathbf{P}_\Delta = \frac{\mathbf{P}_F - \mathbf{P}_M}{\|\mathbf{P}_F - \mathbf{P}_M\|}
$$
Define a line 
$$
\mathbf{l}(t) = t\mathbf{P}_\Delta + \mathbf{P}_M
$$
We would like to find where this line coming from the male intersects the screen. 
$$
\begin{align}
(\mathbf{l}(t)-\mathbf{V})\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j}} &= 0 \\
t\mathbf{P}_\Delta\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j}} + (\mathbf{P}_M-\mathbf{V})\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j}} &=0 \\
t &=\frac{(\mathbf{V}- \mathbf{P}_M )\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j}} }{\mathbf{P}_\Delta\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j}} }
\end{align}
$$
Thus, the projective position of the female on the video monitor is
$$
\mathbf{P}^\prime_F = \left[\frac{(\mathbf{V}- \mathbf{P}_M )\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j}} }{\mathbf{P}_\Delta\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j}} }\right]\mathbf{P}_\Delta + \mathbf{P}_M
$$
 This is neat but it only gives the position of the female's centroid. We would really like to see the projective position of the  female's bounding box. 

From $(6)$, the projective bounding box dimensions scale nonlinearly. However, this need not be worried about, as $(6)$ is easy to implement in MATLAB and can easily be used twice, once for the bounding box sides and once for the bounding box. 

Here is the MATLAB implementation of the above

The core planar projection function 

```matlab
function projection = planarProjection(p1, p2, r0, n)
% We do this because I had difficulties when 
% the variable passed were ints
    p1=double(p1);
    p2=double(p2);
    r0=double(r0);
    n=double(n);
    
    dp = (p2-p1);
    t = ((r0-p1)*n')./(dp * n');
    projection = p1 + t.*dp;    
end
```

Now we'll actually use this magic to make fly relevant computations

```matlab
function [dWid, dHig, hOff, tAng, color] = dotCorrectedPositionalData(d, tAng, tDis)
% d = getConstants()

% The following variable names are explained
% in the paper "Deriving Projections on Planes"
% in my notes directory in Dropbox

% Converting from mm to pixels
R = tDis*d.mm2pix;
D = d.scrDisPix;
scrCntrX = 1920/2;
scrCntrY = D;
scrCntrZ = 1080/2;
% These initial position are important 
% if we dont want to run an affine transformation
% on P_F later on
P_M  = double([scrCntrX 0 scrCntrZ]);
V    = double([scrCntrX scrCntrY scrCntrZ]);
jhat = double([0 1 0]);
P_F = P_M + [R.*sind(tAng) R.*cosd(abs(tAng)) 0*tAng];

% This is why the geometrical algorithm is so cool
lBBox = [-d.halfHi1mm 0 0]*d.mm2pix;
rBBox = [d.halfHi1mm 0 0]*d.mm2pix;
tBBox = [0 d.halfHi1mm 0]*d.mm2pix;
bBBox = [0 -d.halfHi1mm 0]*d.mm2pix;

% Gives the screen coordinates of the projection
Pprime_F_left       = round(planarProjection(P_M, P_F + lBBox, V, jhat));
Pprime_F_right      = round(planarProjection(P_M, P_F + rBBox, V, jhat));
Pprime_F_top        = round(planarProjection(P_M, P_F + tBBox, V, jhat));
Pprime_F_bottom     = round(planarProjection(P_M, P_F + bBBox, V, jhat));
Pprime_F   = round(planarProjection(P_M, P_F        , V, jhat));

dP = Pprime_F_left-Pprime_F;
dWid = uint16(dP(:, 1));
dHig = uint16(dP(:, 2));
hOff = int16(Pprime_F(:,1:2)) ;
tAng = single(tAng(:));
color = single(ones(length(dWid),1)*1);

end
```
