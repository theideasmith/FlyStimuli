## Modelling

The most obvious thing to model here is $\text{amplitude}(\text{distance}, \text{mFv}, â€¦)$. This is what was done in the paper with a GLM. 

Some other things to model are:

1. Recurrent/autoregressive convolutional visual network to predict amplitude modulation. See what the temporal filters that the convolutional network learns out are. This is actually doable. 
2. Lower dimensional mapping of visual stimulus position to amplitude. 

The issue is the data is extremely sparse so there isn't much potential for serious modelling. The questions being asked are more correlational in nature as opposed to model-based.
