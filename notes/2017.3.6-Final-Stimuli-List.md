## Stimuli List

We will be running experiments to test what visual features matter most in amplitude modulation. This is a list of stimuli features to test. 
This list edits the list located in `2017.26.6-Stimuli-List.md`. 

1. **Shape** Outline of `[Box, Circle]`
2. **Aspect Ratio**: smooth changing of aspect ratio to see what the timescale of this being an issue is
3. **Color**:  black and blue, nothing fancy 
4. Is the fly responsive to azimuthal **and** distal **jitter**? Jitter will just decrease the smoothness of the signal.
5. Stimulus flickers or **disappears** for different intervals, **specifically 470ms and 30ms.** 
6. Upwards and downwards movement. 
7. Two stimuli, one in each eye and nothing in the binocular region.
8. Real fly 360 photorealistic fly images. Do they make a difference.  
9. Closed loop, needs additional discussion.

What is the quantitification of fly performance such that different trials can actually be compared? Is it pulse-stimulus *tuning* curves?
