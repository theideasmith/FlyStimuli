## High Temporal Resolution Pulse Segmentation

Today I implemented kmeans clustering for pulse trains. This enables high resolution clustering of pulse trains based on the number of pulses. We can do this on a micro and a macro scale. At later stages, this tool will be important as it enables us to look at distance vs pulse amplitude. 

Right now we just use $N=3$ for the higher resolution clusters. It will take a bit more time and thought to compute this number dynamically. Perhaps something involving the distributions of IPIs. I suppose what we can do is take the number of clusters to be a function of the number of IPIs above one standard deviation from the mean IPI.

My hypothesis that a 3rd degree polynomial provides the best fit might not hold out. It seems the data is too sparse. We need more distance modulation data.

Here are some pulse clusterings at a higher temporal resolution:
