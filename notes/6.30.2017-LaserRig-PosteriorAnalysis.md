## Quantifications for Comparing Stimulus Results

It is important to have a roadmap ahead of time regarding how to interpret the meaningfulness of our results. In particular, we need to define baseline expections, i.e. priors, on the behavior of the fly in a *no modulation* task. We then need to define appropriate statistics of comparison such that we can gauge the relevance of the results we observe. 

I got some inspiration from reading the first chapter of *Dayan and Abbott*. 

1. Compute amplitude vs distance plots
2. Pulse frequency vs distance tuning curves
3. Time delayed amplitude tuning. 

It is necessary to think about the formal definition of all these quantities. In addition

- We also need baselines from the real amplitude vs distance data.
- Determine if the dropoff at $\propto r^3$ correction has any meaning. 

Professor Murthy spoke about having $N=10$ for each trial so it is necessary to do some pilot runs to make sure everything works properly before going on with $\mathcal{O}(100)$ experiments, on the order of 50 hours worth of experimentation. We don't want to have to redo everything.
